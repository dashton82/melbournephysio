            "After landing on my shoulder during a mountain bike accident, I waited 6 weeks hoping it would heel.
            I then went to see Stuart, who quickly diagnosed what was wrong. After the first session I quickly noticed an improvement, 
            and felt more mobility and a lot less pain. I then went for a second session where Stuart showed me easy ways of improving the strength of 
            my shoulder without causing further injury, as well as fully clearing the swelling in my shoulder. 
            I'm now back in the gym, biking and sleeping a lot better. 
            Thanks Stuart."
